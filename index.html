        <p>I Like playing Cricket.Cricket is celebrated and practiced as a sport in many countries. It is played within a 22-yard oval field with two teams competing against each other. Each team includes 11 players who can be batters, all-rounders as well as bowlers. The game starts with a toss and is played on the basis of overs where each over has 6 balls to be bowled. Runs can be scored by hitting the ball out of the boundary in the form of fours and sixes or by running between the wickets to take singles. The total number of overs depends on the format of the game.<br>India plays cricket both as a sport and a recreation. Youngsters can be seen with their bats and balls in every nook and corner of the country. The Indian Cricket teams of both men and women represent the nation in different tournaments. The dedication and popularity of this game make it larger than life everywhere!<br>
